I was not able to get a Detail Page complete.  
  In the App component I have a route that returns data for a single Product but I wasn't able to make a component with that data. 
  
  I did not get to edit a Product.  In my mind, the Detail view would have been the ideal place to edit a Product.  In App I have an editProduct function that recognizes one Product to edit. I then set Editing to be true and in  the Detail page I planned to show a form with the current values from state filled in.  From there a PUT req and update logic in SQL would save changes.

  There are some CSS bugs in the grid I would like to fix so every Product component is uniform.

I would welcome the chance for a code review and to explain some of the decisions that I made and how I set out from the start.
